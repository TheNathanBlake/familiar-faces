A remarkable WordPress plugin designed to show off the amazing people working by your side.

== Description ==

The Familiar Faces plugin, currently in the early stages of development, allows you to plug a slide of your coworkers or teammates (or cats) anywhere on the website.  The current goal is to make this as customizable as possible on the user-end, without touching the PHP.

*   "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wp.org/wp-plugins.org usernames
*   "Tags" is a comma separated list of tags that apply to the plugin
*   "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
*   "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*. Note that it might work on
higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
*   Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
stable.

    Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so
if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used
for displaying information about the plugin.  In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk `readme.txt`
is the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in
your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version
that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.

    If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where
you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.

== Installation ==

This plugin is rather simple to install and implement.

1. Upload everything to a folder in the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress (it will be Familiar Faces)

== Adding Content ==

Before the plugin does anything, you'll need to set up your people.
1. In the dashboard, click the Familiar Faces tab (dog icon) to visit the settings page.
2. Click the (+) icon and fill in the information.  Not all information is required, and you may edit content by
	clicking a face at a later point.
3. Click the Submit button to add the new profile to the list of faces.  The page must be refreshed before new
	content can be seen.  This bug will be fixed as development continues.

== Modifing Content ==

Content can be freely edited in the settings page, similarly to adding content.

== Deleting Content ==

In the settings page, click on the face you wish to edit and click (Delete) at the bottom of the content.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why has nobody asked you any questions? =

Good question.  Email me something.

= What about foo bar? =

You ever wonder what a foobar is?

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets 
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png` 
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
